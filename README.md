# Expense Tracker API

A backend REST API built with Spring Boot to manage and analyze personal expenses.

This API supports CRUD operations, categories, summary reports, and basic validations. Data is persisted using the H2 in-memory database by default, which makes setup quick and easy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Overview

The backend is designed to manage user expenses efficiently and consistently.

### Expense Entity
Represents a single expense record with the following fields:
-   `id` (Long): A unique identifier for the expense.
-   `amount` (Double): The monetary value of the expense.
-   `date` (String): The date of the expense in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
-   `category` (String): The category of the expense (e.g., `FOOD`, `TRAVEL`).
-   `note` (String): An optional note or description.

### Validation Rules
-   **Amount**: Must be a numeric value greater than 0.
-   **Date**: Must follow the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
-   **Category**: Must be one of the predefined values in `ExpenseCategoryEnum`. An invalid category will trigger a validation error.

### ErrorResponse
A standard structure for returning validation or runtime errors.
-   `status`: The HTTP status code.
-   `message`: A clear description of the error.
-   `timestamp`: The time when the error occurred.
